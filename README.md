Angular is a popular framework for building web applications. Version 15 brings several improvements and new features. Here's a simplified explanation of some key concepts:

1. **Components**: Components are like building blocks of your web app. They have a template (HTML) for the layout, styles (CSS) for the appearance, and logic (TypeScript) for the behavior. For example, a component for a product list might have HTML to display the list, CSS to style it, and TypeScript to handle interactions.

   ```typescript
   import { Component } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-product-list',
     templateUrl: './product-list.component.html',
     styleUrls: ['./product-list.component.css']
   })
   export class ProductListComponent {
     // Component logic goes here
   }
   ```

2. **Directives**: Directives are instructions in the HTML that tell Angular how to modify the DOM. There are two types: structural directives, which change the structure of the DOM (e.g., `*ngFor` for looping), and attribute directives, which change the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g., `*ngIf` for conditional rendering).

   ```html
   <ul>
     <li *ngFor="let product of products">{{ product.name }}</li>
   </ul>
   ```

3. **Services**: Services are reusable pieces of code that perform specific tasks, such as fetching data from a server or handling business logic. They help keep your components lean and focused on UI-related tasks.

   ```typescript
   import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: 'root'
   })
   export class ProductService {
     // Service logic goes here
   }
   ```

4. **Modules**: Modules are containers for a group of related components, directives, pipes, and services. They help organize your app into cohesive blocks and enable you to manage dependencies more effectively.

   ```typescript
   import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
   import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';

   @NgModule({
     declarations: [
       AppComponent,
       ProductListComponent
     ],
     imports: [
       BrowserModule
     ],
     providers: [],
     bootstrap: [AppComponent]
   })
   export class AppModule { }
   ```

5. **Routing**: Routing allows you to navigate between different parts of your app based on the URL. You define routes in your application, which map URLs to components.

   ```typescript
   import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

   const routes: Routes = [
     { path: 'products', component: ProductListComponent },
     { path: '', redirectTo: '/products', pathMatch: 'full' }
   ];

   @NgModule({
     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
     exports: [RouterModule]
   })
   export class AppRoutingModule { }
   ```

These are just a few of the concepts in Angular. Version 15 builds upon these foundations to make it easier and more powerful to build web applications.
